Unit testing is means to write a program that tests a certain method or class.
A single method usually recieves multiple unit tests, testing out a normal case of the method, then the extreme cases of the method, then an invalid case of the method, and sometimes a performance test of the method.
A benefit to unit testing is that if it is writen well, it improves the quality of the code and gives the expectation the code is bug free.
Another benefit is that used continously so you can tell almost exactly when an error appears in your code.
